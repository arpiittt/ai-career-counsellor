## üöÄ How to Run

This project is set up for easy deployment and development using **GitHub Codespaces**, providing a consistent and ready-to-go environment.

### 1. Open in Codespaces

- Click the "Code" button on this GitHub repository page.
- Navigate to the **"Codespaces"** tab.
- Select **"Create codespace on main."**

> The Codespaces environment is pre-configured to install dependencies and set up the Rasa project via `.devcontainer/postCreateCommand`.

### 2. Start Services in Separate Terminals

Once Codespaces is initialized, run the following in **three separate terminal windows**:

#### Terminal 1: Rasa Action Server
```bash
rasa run actions
```

#### Terminal 2: Rasa Core & NLU Server
```bash
rasa run --enable-api --cors "*" --endpoints endpoints.yml
```

#### Terminal 3: Streamlit Frontend
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 3. Access the Application

- A new tab should open automatically with the Streamlit interface.
- If not, check the **Ports** tab in Codespaces (usually port `8501`).

## üåê Optional: Accessing Rasa from Outside Codespaces (via ngrok)

If you need to expose your Rasa server (port 5005) publicly:

1. **Install & authenticate ngrok:**
   - Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)
   - Get your authtoken and run:
     ```bash
     ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_ACTUAL_AUTHTOKEN_HERE
     ```

2. **Start ngrok tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5005
   ```

- You'll receive a public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://xxxx-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ngrok-free.app`)
- Update `RASA_API_URL` in `app.py` with this URL if deploying the Streamlit app externally.
